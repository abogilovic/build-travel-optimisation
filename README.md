# build-travel-optimisation

- Pathfinding using my implementation of flood-fill algorithm for weighted tiles
- Combinatorics for less combinations <0% error>
- Heuristic approach for some <x% error> boundary (incoming)
 
Image of optimal places to build offices(blue) and their paths which connects them with customers(yellow) for lowest traveling costs:
